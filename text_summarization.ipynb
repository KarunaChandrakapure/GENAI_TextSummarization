    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade.

Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

He expresses gratitude to the people of India, living both domestically and abroad, for their support during his tenure. He intends to share some unique experiences from his interactions, which convey the following key message:\n",

      "\n",
      "The speaker begins by mentioning that they have some unique experiences to share, which convey these important messages. The messages are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Promote agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\".\n",

      "\n",
      "However, the actual anecdote is not provided in the given text, but it likely relates to Anukriti's question and how it inspired the speaker to think about the aspirations of the youth in accelerating development in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was reminded of a speech given by a student named Anukriti from Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School in Darwa village, Haryana. Anukriti had asked the speaker why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. The speaker was impressed by the question and promised to take it to the highest institution of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be from the President of India (likely Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam) and emphasizes the aspirations of the nation's youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. He notes that over 15 lakh youth share this desire, representing 540 million young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The President recalls a visit to a tribal village in Nagaland in 2002, where he saw an empowered village council functioning effectively with financial powers. However, he highlights the need for improved physical connectivity in rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker had a transformative experience in Nagaland, where they saw a prosperous village with high production of fruits and vegetables. However, they noted that the village lacked physical connectivity (quality roads) to transport products to the market. This led to a realization that empowering villages to manage their own development and connecting them with urban societies could bring about significant transformation across India's 600,000 villages.

      "One of the notable initiatives he undertook was the Pan African e-Network project, launched in 2004, which aimed to provide seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. The project provided telemedicine and tele-education services to 53 African countries, with 12 universities and 17 Super Specialty Hospitals connected. The pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, showcasing the potential of technology to bridge the gap between developed and developing nations. Furthermore, the Indira Gandhi National Open University has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities, while specialists from CARE Hospital have contributed to the telemedicine initiative, highlighting the collaborative efforts to promote education and healthcare across Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the Pan African e-Network has also enabled live tele-consultation between doctors in India and Africa, such as doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, and Hyderabad. This initiative has enabled the sharing of expertise and knowledge between the two regions, promoting healthcare and education. Kalam was also proud to visit the Indian Army's KUMAR post in Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and experience a Sukhoi-30 fighter, showcasing the bravery and dedication of the Indian armed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his tenure, Kalam had the opportunity to interact with the brave men and women of the Indian Defence Forces, who selflessly serve the nation. He praised their valour, commitment, and devotion to duty, saying that they remain vigilant to guard the nation even in the most adverse circumstances. He also acknowledged the contributions of the para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces, who work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of the citizens. Their unwavering dedication to duty is truly commendable, and their efforts have earned the nation's gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Kalam's legacy is a testament to his vision for a developed India, where rural and urban areas are connected, the needs and aspirations of the youth are addressed, and the indomitable spirit of the people is nurtured through inclusive development initiatives. His efforts to promote education and healthcare across Africa have also left a lasting impact, demonstrating the potential of technology to bridge the gap between developed and developing nations.\n",

      "In his departing speech, APJ Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the people of India for the opportunity to serve as President. He highlighted his enriching experience working with individuals from diverse backgrounds, including politics, science, academics, and more. He also emphasized the importance of accelerating development, particularly catering to the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A poignant moment during his tenure was when a little girl named Anukriti from Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School in Darwa village, Haryana, visited Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006. Anukriti asked him a thought-provoking question: \"Why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020?\" Kalam appreciated the question, assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, and committed to working towards making her aspiration a reality. This encounter underscored the significance of addressing the needs and aspirations of the country's youth to drive progress and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam's vision for a developed India was not limited to urban areas. He also recognized the potential of rural India, as seen in his visit to Nagaland's Khuizama village in 2002. There, he witnessed an empowered tribal village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and overseeing a prosperous village with fruits and vegetable production. However, he noted that a need for providing physical connectivity through quality roads exists to enable faster movement of products from villages to the market. He envisioned a transformation that could take place in the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages were empowered to deal with their development and well connected among themselves and with the urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To bridge the rural-urban divide, Kalam supported initiatives such as the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) complex, which aimed to provide three connectivities - physical, electronic, and knowledge - in 65 villages with a population of 300,000. This initiative has led to significant economic development, including the creation of employment opportunities through self-help groups and entrepreneurship. The villagers have successfully cultivated land, planted various crops, generated power using biomass, and established marketing centers, resulting in a sustainable economic development model for the region. Furthermore, the technological support from experts at Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women has enabled the villagers to work collaboratively and efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the success of the Periyar PURA villages has been replicated across the region, with the people working with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative ability of the people, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products. Kalam's vision for inclusive development has inspired the creation of similar PURA initiatives in many states, and he envisions 7,000 such projects across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his efforts in rural development, Kalam also worked towards empowering farmers to protect and nurture fertile land for a second green revolution. He met with over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories, who showed keen interest in various gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, including Mughal Gardens, Herbal Gardens, Spiritual Garden, Musical Garden, Bio-diesel garden, and Nutrition Garden. His vision was to double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. He advocated for a partnership between farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries to increase the agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also demonstrated a deep appreciation for the resilience of the Indian people, particularly in the face of adversity. During his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was recovering from the devastating earthquake in 2005, he witnessed firsthand the indomitable spirit of the people and children. He praised the villagers' courage in defeating their problems, showcasing their resilience and determination in the face of adversity, and becoming the master of their problems rather than allowing them to become their master.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Kalam's interactions with individuals from diverse backgrounds have left a lasting impact on him. One such encounter was with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person with no hands and legs, who visited him on February 24, 2007. Krishna Murthy's radiant smile and happy state of mind despite his physical challenges inspired Kalam's commitment to creating opportunities for people with disabilities to contribute to the nation's development. This interaction also highlighted the importance of nurturing latent talent and encouraging individuals to give back to society, as Krishna Murthy sang melodiously in front of Kalam, showcasing his musical talent.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Kalam was also inspired by the efforts of the Youth movement for Developed India 2020, initiated by the Lead India 2020 Foundation created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad. This initiative has been training thousands of students in many districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. Particularly, he noted the transformation that has taken place among the students of Medak district, where the impact of the training is visible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, shedding of stage fear, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. Ms. Padma, a student leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda, also shared her experiences of how the training has empowered her to take on leadership roles and make a positive impact in her community.\n",
